"""Per-script data and passes, selected by the jurisdiction config.

The structurer used to decide "is this Arabic?" by counting codepoints at runtime,
with Arabic tables inline in the general modules, so every ingest paid for Arabic
handling and a second script meant editing `anchors.py` again. Every config already
declares `display.script`, which is now the authoritative selector; codepoint
detection is the fallback where a document disagrees with its jurisdiction.

The convention: script data and script-only passes live in `scripts/<script>.py`,
general algorithms stay in `enrich/` and take a pack.
