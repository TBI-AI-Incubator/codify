"""Region-aware structure text: what the structurer should see.

`combine_page_texts` gives every consumer the full page markdown, and metadata
plus the validator want that superset. The structurer must not weave furniture
into provisions, so this filters the combined text: `header` and `footer` lines
are dropped and `footnote` lines are relocated to the foot as standalone
paragraphs the body-fill emits separably, so the footnote lift catches them
deterministically. Regions decide which lines move; the kept text stays the
authoritative markdown. `aside`, `body` and `unknown` lines are never touched.

A region acts only on the page it was observed on. A heading that straddles a
page break is emitted twice, once as a catchword at the foot of the page and
again as the real heading overleaf; matching the catchword document-wide deleted
both, and with them whole chapters and articles.

One text-level filter serves both ingest lanes (the in-process PDF path and the
durable API structure step), so they cannot drift. Lives apart from `ocr.py`
because it depends on `regions`, which depends on `ocr`; that avoids the cycle.
