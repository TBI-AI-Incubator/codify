"""Corrections that must survive every later translation of a law. Regeneration follows
every pipeline change and the model never repeats itself, so a reviewer's correction
decays unless something holds it. A pin is a work URI, target language, eId and
substring; the delivery gate refuses a translation that has lost one. Pins assert a
phrase, not a provision, so rewording stays free; each ``why`` records its defect.
They live in ``pins/<jurisdiction>.jsonl`` beside this module. A pin is meaningful
only if its eId resolves, so resolve a new one against a real translation first::
