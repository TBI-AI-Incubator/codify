"""What a scan records about itself.

An ingest that finds nothing still reports success, because the coverage gate's
denominator comes from the same keywords the scanner failed to find and a
document with no keywords therefore has no expected set to fall short of. The
scan trace is what makes that visible, so these tests pin the three things a
reader needs from it: which pass produced each anchor, which numbers coverage
compared, and that a trace is emitted on the paths that produce no scaffold.
