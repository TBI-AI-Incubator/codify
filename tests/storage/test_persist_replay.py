"""What running the persist writes twice actually does to the corpus.

The ingest workflow's persist body used to run as workflow code, so recovery
re-executed it in full. The safety argument for that was `save_document`'s
dedup on (work, lang, hash). These establish where that argument holds and
where it does not, so the checkpoint that now covers it has a measured reason
rather than an asserted one.

Nothing here says `supersede_document` is wrong. Deleting before it saves is
what supersede is for. The finding is only that running it twice is not the
same as running it once.
