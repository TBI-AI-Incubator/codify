"""A jurisdiction the pipeline does not know must stop it, not be papered over.

Without a config the pipeline does not fail: it falls back to defaults and emits
a plausible bundle for a jurisdiction it knows nothing about. That is the worst
shape for an external user, because nothing prompts them to look. It matters more
after the open-core split, where five of 257 configs ship and every other code a
user might name lands on this path.
